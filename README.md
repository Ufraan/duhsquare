# FeedFlow

Welcome to FeedFlow! FeedFlow is a food-sharing platform that aims to connect online delivery platforms, restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals with excess edible food to local community organizations dedicated to feeding the less fortunate.

## Idea Description

FeedFlow acts as a bridge between various entities in the food industry and community organizations. It facilitates the redistribution of surplus food that would otherwise go to waste, ensuring it reaches those in need. Here's how it works:

- **Online Delivery Platforms**: FeedFlow collaborates with online delivery platforms to redirect orders that have been canceled but are still edible.
- **Restaurants and Grocery Stores**: These establishments can donate excess food inventory that would otherwise be discarded.
- **Individuals**: People with extra unwanted edible food can also contribute by listing it on the platform.
- **Community Organizations**: FeedFlow connects all these sources of food surplus to local community organizations that focus on feeding the poor and needy.

By leveraging technology and collaboration, FeedFlow strives to reduce food waste while addressing hunger in communities.
